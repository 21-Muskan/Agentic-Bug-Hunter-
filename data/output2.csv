"ID","Bug Line","Explanation"
"16","1","The line 1 code `rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::VECD);` is incorrect because it does not specify the mode for editing vectors at runtime. According to the documentation, the `vecEditMode` function requires a parameter of type `TA::Mode` which can be either `TA::VECD` or `TA::VTT`. However, the documentation also states that when `rdi.smartVec().label().copyLabel()` is used and different vectors in the same label are to be edited, only the `VTT` mode can be used. Therefore, the correct code should be `rdi.smartVec().vecEditMode(TA::VTT);`"
"32","3,5","The `burst()` method is called twice on the same `rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func()` object, which is incorrect. The correct usage is to call `burst()` once to create the multi-port burst label, and then call `execute()` to execute the burst. See Doc 5 for correct usage.; The `burst()` method is called twice on the same `rdi.port(TA::MULTI_PORT).func()` object, which is incorrect. The correct usage is to call `burst()` once to create the multi-port burst label, and then call `execute()` to execute the burst. See Doc 5 for correct usage."
"25","6","The write() function is called with two arguments, iAddr and sData, but the documentation shows that the correct usage is write(iAddr, iData) or write(iAddr, sData). The code is using sData with a string value 'data', but the documentation does not specify that sData can be a string. It is likely that the correct usage is write(iAddr, iData) with iData being an integer value, but the code is using a string value instead."
"10","2","The function name is incorrect. The correct function name is readHumSensor, not readHumanSeniority."
"26","5,9","The addWaveform() function does not support adding a waveform multiple times in one execute() operation. This is stated in the documentation (Doc 1).; The addWaveform() function does not support adding a waveform multiple times in one execute() operation. This is stated in the documentation (Doc 1)."
"23","25","The `burstUpload()` method is called on `rdi.burstUpload.smartVec()` instead of `rdi.smartVec().burstUpload()`."
"4","3","Incorrect order of setting parameters for DC Scale Pin. According to Doc 4, the correct order is: force mode, force range, force/clamp, meas range, meas wait, meas, restore range, and then connect. The provided code sets force range before force mode."
"31","2,5","The function 'burst()' is not a valid function for the 'vec_port1' vector. The correct function to use is 'execute()' or 'label()' depending on the context.; The function 'push_forward()' is not a valid function for the 'vec_port1' vector. The correct function to use is 'push_back()'."
"17","","No bugs detected"
"27","2","The function name is misspelled as `imeasRange` instead of `iMeasRange`."
"24","","No bugs detected"
"14","8","The getAlarmBurstValue method requires a string parameter for the pin name, but the provided pin name 'AVI' is not a valid pin name. The correct pin name should be used instead."
"9","3","The code calls `rdi.cogo().end().end();` which is incorrect. According to the documentation, the correct usage is `rdi.cogo().node().end();`."
"13","3,4,5","The function name 'getVesjkctor' is incorrect. The correct function name is 'getVector'.; The function name 'getVslkhalue' is incorrect. The correct function name is 'getValue'.; The function name 'getWlkjnaveform' is incorrect. The correct function name is 'getWaveform'."
"22","3","The function name is incorrect. The correct function name is `readTempThresh` without the argument `70`. The correct usage is `readTempThresh()`."
"29","4,5,6","The function rdi.route().retrievePmuxPinStatus() is used to retrieve the status of a pmux switch in both online mode and offline mode. However, the pin name 'P0x08F1' is not defined in the previous setup, which may lead to incorrect results or errors. This is because the pin name 'P0x08F1' is not defined in the routing setup file as mentioned in the documentation.; The function rdi.route().retrievePmuxPinStatus() is used to retrieve the status of a pmux switch in both online mode and offline mode. However, the pin name 'P0x08F1' is not defined in the previous setup, which may lead to incorrect results or errors. This is because the pin name 'P0x08F1' is not defined in the routing setup file as mentioned in the documentation.; Bug detected"
"2","3","The `vForceRange` and `iForceRange` parameters are set to 35 V and 50 mA respectively, but according to the documentation, the `vForceRange` should be 30 V for the pin `m_rMcd.sP_LIN`."
"20","1","The function call `rdi.digCapBurstSiteUpload(false)` is incorrect because the parameter `digCapBurstSiteUpload` should be a boolean value, but it is being passed as a function call. The correct usage is `rdi.digCapBurstSiteUpload(true)` or `rdi.digCapBurstSiteUpload(false)` without the parentheses."
"11","3","The 'average' parameter is missing in the call to rdi.dc().pin(""dig2"").iForce(1 uA).vMeans().execute();. According to the documentation, the 'average' parameter should be specified using the 'average()' method."
"3","4","The iClamp range is specified as (-50 mA, 50 mA), but the iClamp values are specified as -50 mA and 50 mA, which is incorrect. The correct order should be iClamp(low, high)."
