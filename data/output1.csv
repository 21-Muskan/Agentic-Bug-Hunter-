"ID","Bug Line","Explanation"
"16","1","The function name is 'rdi.smartVec()' but it seems to be missing the return value 'rdi' which is used in the following lines. It should be 'rdi = rdi.smartVec()' to maintain consistency."
"32","3,5","The .func() method is called twice on the same port, which may not be the intended behavior. The documentation suggests that .func() is used for dynamic mode, but it's unclear if it can be used multiple times.; The .burst() method is called twice on the same port, which may not be the intended behavior. The documentation suggests that multi-port labels can be combined to form a new burst, but it's unclear if .burst() can be called multiple times on the same port."
"25","4","The function name is 'rdi.protocol().write()' but the code is calling 'rdi.runTimeVal()' which is not mentioned in the documentation. It should be 'rdi.protocol().write()'."
"10","2","The function name 'readHumanSeniority' seems to be incorrect. It should be 'readHumidity' based on the context/documentation."
"26","5","The argument 2 in the addWaveform() function is likely incorrect, as it should be a waveform object or a group of waveforms, not a numerical value."
"23","4","The argument TA::EMAP is not used in the context of TA::DIGCAP. It seems like a typo and should be TA::DIGCAP instead of TA::EMAP."
"4","3","Incorrect argument order for vForce() and vForceRange(). The correct order should be vForce() followed by vForceRange()."
"31","2,5,6","The function 'burst' is not defined for the vector 'vec_port1'. The correct function name is 'burstRunTime' as per the documentation.; The function 'push_forward' is not a valid function for vectors in C++. The correct function name is 'push_back'.; The function 'push_forward' is not a valid function for vectors in C++. The correct function name is 'push_back'."
"17","8","The function name is 'getFFC' but the context/documentation mentions getting the first fail vector, which should be 'getFFV'."
"27","2","The unit of the imeasRange() function is specified as uA, but the value is 100, which seems to be in mA. It should be 0.1 uA to match the unit."
"24","3","Missing closing parenthesis at the end of the line, likely intended to be 'interSamples(10)'"
"14","","No bugs detected"
"9","3","The code calls `end()` twice, which is likely a mistake. The correct usage should be `end()` followed by `wait()` or other operations, not `end()` followed by another `end()`."
"13","3,4,5","Typo in function name 'getVesjkctor', should be 'getVector'; Typo in function name 'getVslkhalue', should be 'getValue'; Typo in function name 'getWlkjnaveform', should be 'getWaveform'"
"22","2","The argument passed to the pmux function seems to be incorrect. The documentation mentions reading the temperature alarm threshold of the selected PMUX card, but the argument passed is 1, which might not be the correct PMUX card index."
"29","2,3","The setOff() and setOn() methods are called on the wrong route object. They should be called on the route object that is setting the pin state, not the one that is executing the pin state change.; The setOff() and setOn() methods are called on the wrong route object. They should be called on the route object that is setting the pin state, not the one that is executing the pin state change."
"2","3","The unit of '13.5 V' should be 'V' instead of 'V' (no unit). It should be '13.5V' or '13.5V' with a space for better readability."
"20","1","The function name is misspelled as 'rdi.digCapBurstSiteUpload' instead of the correct function name based on the context, which seems to be 'rdi.digCap'."
"11","3","Incorrect function name: 'iForce' should be 'vForce' for voltage measurement, and 'iRange' should be 'vRange' for voltage range measurement."
"3","4","Incorrect usage of vForceRange and iForceRange methods. The first argument should be the minimum value and the second argument should be the maximum value. The current usage is in the opposite order."
