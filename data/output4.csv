"16","5,10","VTT mode required for copyLabel; VTT mode required for copyLabel"
"32","2,3,5","vForce(1 uA) should be vForce(1 V) or within valid range.; Extra burst() call after burst(""MPBurst2"").; Extra burst() call after burst(""MPBurst1"")."

"26","5,9","addWaveform() cannot be used in parallel with vForce(); iMeas() should come after addWaveform()"
"23","25,30","Incorrect method chaining: rdi.burstUpload.smartVec().end() should be rdi.smartVec().burstUpload().end(); ON_FIRST_INVOCATION_END() should be outside RDI_BEGIN()/RDI_END() block"
"4","3,4","iClamp args swapped: iClamp(50 mA, -50 mA) should be iClamp(-50 mA, 50 mA); iClamp args swapped: iClamp(-5 uA, 5 uA) should be iClamp(5 uA, -5 uA)"
"31","2,5,6,9","vec_port1.burst() is not a valid method.; vec_port1.push_forward should be push_back.; vec_port2.push_forward should be push_back.; func id 'idd' does not match port 'A'."

"22","3,7","readTempThresh() does not take arguments; Correct module ID should be 1, not 1"
"29","4,5,6","Missing execute() after retrievePmuxPinStatus; Missing execute() after retrievePmuxPinStatus; Pin P0x08F1 not defined in setup"
"2","3,4","iClamp args swapped: iClamp(-50 mA, 50 mA) should be iClamp(50 mA, -50 mA); vForceRange exceeds max: vForceRange(35 V) should be vForceRange(30 V)"
